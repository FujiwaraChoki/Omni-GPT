# OmniGPT

Have you heard of Auto-GPT? Chances are yes..
OmniGPT is my own *extremely* simplified version of it, an experiment to make ChatGPT
fully autonomuous using ChatGPT's API.

It's a lightweight alternative of Auto-GPT.

## Get started

1. To get started, firstly, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FujiwaraChoki/OmniGPT.git
```

2. Now you need to run the docker container, simply run it using the Dev Containers Extension from VS Code.

3. Start typing!
